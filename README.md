## What is Java Spring Boot?

Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:

1. Autoconfiguration - applications are initialized with pre-set dependencies that you don't have to configure manually.

2. An opinionated approach to configuration - Spring Boot uses an opinionated approach to adding and configuring starter dependencies, based on the needs of your project.

3. The ability to create standalone applications - Specifically, it lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process.

These features work together to provide you with a tool that allows you to set up a Spring-based application with minimal configuration and setup.

## What is Thymeleaf?

Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments.

Thymeleaf's main goal is to bring elegant natural templates to your development workflow — HTML that can be correctly displayed in browsers and also work as static prototypes, allowing for stronger collaboration in development teams.

With modules for Spring Framework, a host of integrations with your favourite tools, and the ability to plug in your own functionality, Thymeleaf is ideal for modern-day HTML5 JVM web development — although there is much more it can do.
